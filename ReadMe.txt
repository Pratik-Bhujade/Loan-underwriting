This project is focused to build a loan underwriting prediction method using machine leaning and reinforcement learning methods.
The project is coded using Python 3.7 in Anaconda Environment using Jupyer Notebooks.

The following libraraies are needed to install to run the codes.
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. SciPy
4. matplotlib
5. Seaborn
6. imblearn
7. Sklearn .. and base other base python libraries.

The code is divided into two parts.

PART A - Q-Learning model: Exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, feature selection, model implementation
PART B - User interface for the loan underwriting system application using python Flask app 

The codes needed to be executed in the same manner.

Apart from .ipynb and  there are .html files for each of the user interface. The data is also provided.

There is a word document containing the project report/thesis and a powerpoint presentation.

Note - If you want to test the accuracy by using user interface, please change the values of target column i.e (0 and 1).
Path of Folder - LoanUnderwritingUI/application_test.csv. You will have to change the TARGET values in application_test.csv
